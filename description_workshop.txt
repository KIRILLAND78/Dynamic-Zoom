This mod automatically zoom in your screen in towns (if no boss or invasion is present) and zoom out when leaving.

There is also config so you can change anything according to your liking.

Probably will break with mods tampering with zoom settings. No, i will not fix that.

Created by request of a friend of mine.

I did some reflections and maybe it supports Better Zoom now. Maybe. Probably.

Also now supports AbsoluteZinema.

(i lost source code and had to decompile my own mod to make new update)
